"This is a currency converter program that uses Node.js and the inquirer module to prompt the user for input. It converts the user's specified amount from one currency to another using exchange rates defined in the code. The program then displays the converted amount in a highlighted green color using chalk. The program supports multiple currencies, including USD, EUR, JPY, CAD, AUD, and PKR, and can be easily extended to support additional currencies."
